# COMP90015-Project1

In this assignment, a simple multi-threading dictionary server and client is designed and implemented. 

## Learning outcome
By completing this assignment, I feel more familiar with the applicatoins I used everyday. How the GUI works, why the console would print out messages. 

1. The MVC pattern
2. View program as a collection of objects which communicating with each other.
3. The essense of protocol in distributed system
4. Object serialization and deserialization
5. Design pattern are really powerful for the extensibility and cohesive of the program.
6. Blocking operations in Java are really useful, could build amazing things with it.
7. More familiar with threads, know how the multi-threading program may work.
8. Understand what is a socket, IO. 
9. Understand what is exception in Java and knows how to use it.
10. Understand the controller pattern, why need it. Since I draw it by myself.
11. Interrupt Java thread does not guarantee the execution is down, I have to close the socket to terminate the connection.
12. Java BlockingQueue, ConcurrentHashMap
13. More familar with the data flow from client to server and vice-versa. 
14. Design and implementing program is really fun! I feel so excited why I fully engaged in design then implement my design!
15. knows how to use singleton
16. When GUI is blocked no update could happen.
18. Do not know how to update GUI and processing task concurrently. 
19. understand why need config file. The program would have a lot of setting parameters, and if hard code them inside program, then it would hard to adpt different use environment, so store them in a config file, it is easy for user to change as well as reduce the hard code level. 
### Skill summary
- Thread Pool
- socket programming
- thead programming
- message exchage protocol with JSON
- Java Swing GUI
- MVC architecture pattern and GoF design patterns (singleton, factory and strategy)
